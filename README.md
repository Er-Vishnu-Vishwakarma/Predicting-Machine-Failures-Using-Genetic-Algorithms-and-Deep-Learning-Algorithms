### PROJECT TITLE NAME: Predicting-Machine-Failures-Using-Genetic-Algorithms-and-Deep-Learning-Algorithms
• Description: This project study uses a Predictive Maintenance Dataset from the UCI repository to predict and
classify machine failures.The study has one objectives: checking deep learning methods for better
accuracy.This study explores the integration of Genetic Algorithms (G.A.) with Deep Learning (DL)
algorithms for predictive maintenance using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset.
• Tools Used: MATLAB, Industry 4.0, Genetic Algorithms, Deep Learning (Neural Networks),
Hyperparameter tuning, Predictive maintenance
